Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) for Option Pricing.

Overview:
This project demonstrates the use of a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) for option pricing. The QGAN is trained to generate a quantum state that represents the probability distribution of the future spot price of a financial instrument at maturity. The generated distribution is then used to estimate the expected payoff of a European call option.

Code Structure
The code is organized into the following sections:

1. Setup and Dependencies:
Installation: Ensure that the required packages are installed using the provided pip install commands.

2. Data Preparation:

Uncertainty Model: Set up the uncertainty model for the spot price at maturity. The model is trained to generate a quantum state representing the probability amplitudes of different spot price outcomes.

Trained Model: Load the trained parameters of the uncertainty model.

3. Data Visualization:
   
Probability Distributions: Visualize the trained probability distribution and compare it with a target distribution.

Payoff Function: Plot the exact payoff function of a European call option.

4. Option Pricing:
   
Analytical Payoff: Calculate the expected payoff analytically based on the target distribution.

QGAN Payoff: Use the QGAN-generated distribution to estimate the expected payoff of the European call option.

Confidence Interval: Compute the confidence interval for the estimated payoff.

Results:

The results include visualizations of the probability distributions, a comparison of the analytical and QGAN-based expected payoffs, and a confidence interval for the estimated payoff.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the application of QGANs to option pricing, showcasing their ability to capture complex probability distributions in the financial domain. The estimated option pricing can provide insights into risk assessment and decision-making in financial markets.
